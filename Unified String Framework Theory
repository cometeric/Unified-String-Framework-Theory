Unified String Framework



My theory proposes that perhaps string theory was the key to the theory of everything. It would also solve the problem with string theory when the strings are one dimensional. One of the reasons this matters is because it would be able to explain everything, one of the hardest questions in physics.

String theory should be able to work but it does not, because it is one dimensional.


So a new idea had to be made and it is that string theory is the creator of space-time and is its own dimension.


But then it was realised that perhaps through the vibrations energy would be produced, and that perhaps there is a change in vibration and that change is expanding space-time.

Now we have an idea why the universe is expanding, why energy can appear out of nowhere, where space-time comes from, and perhaps a theory of everything.


Now the general theory of relativity can also be explained by this theory because more matter equals more more strings which equals more space-time.

It could fill in the gap of one dimensional string theory and answer the theory of everything.

Now with superstrings, we know they should create superparticles but what if they are the same as regular strings but could create superenergy, superspace and supertime.
Superenergy would be the opposite of regular energy because superparticles are the opposite of regular particles, so superenergy would not be able to transfer, transform, just remain in the universe, perhaps like dark energy meaning that superenergy could be the same as dark energy.
Superspace would be dimensionless, directionless, positionless and not be able to hold matter. 
Supertime would be what tachyons experience so it would go backwards.

This would also mean that the universe is 5 dimensional, the extra dimension is the strings which are their own dimension.
